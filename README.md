# AtliQ-Hardware-SQL

## Introduction
Atliq Hardware is a company that sells computer hardware products to big retailers like CROMA, Flipkart, Staples, and Bestbuy, who then sell them to individual consumers.  
They make these products in their own factory, store them in a warehouse, and have distribution centers to send them out when they get orders.  

The problem is, Atliq relies too much on Excel files to keep track of everything, and they want to find a better way to manage their data.  
But they can't completely get rid of Excel because it's essential for analyzing data.  

The Data team from AtliQ build database using MySQL which is free and robust and then created data informed decision with the help of SQL Queries.

##### The AtliQ Hardware dataset contains 1425706 records, which was given by Codebasics learning platform for the purpose of learning.
